# srvc

Wrapper scripts for systemd service control. 

## Why?

If I'm frank, I dislike systemd service control. It's not intuitive and frustrating to use. Srvc allows me to have some of the good ol' days of service management. Enjoy!

## Installation

Place file in your excecute path and make it executable (chmod +x). That's it!
